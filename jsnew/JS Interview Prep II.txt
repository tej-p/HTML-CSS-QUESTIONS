Question-Give an example where call apply bind is. required?

Answer-
The call() and apply() are very similar methods. They both execute the bound function on the object 
immediately. The bind() method does not execute the function right away. Instead, it creates and 
returns a bound function that can be executed later.

Question-What is the difference between readFile and readFileSync?

Answer-
readFileSync() is synchronous and blocks execution until finished. These return their results as 
return values. readFile() are asynchronous and return immediately while they function in the 
background. You pass a callback function which gets called when they finish.

Question-What does process in node.js mean?

Answer-
Node. js provides the facility to get process information such as process id, architecture, platform
version, release, uptime, upu usage etc. It can also be used to kill process, set uid, set groups, 
unmask etc. The process is a global object, an instance of EventEmitter, can be accessed from 
anywhere.

Question-Explain what node.js is?

Answer-
Node. js (Node) is an open source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side. 
Node is useful for developing applications that require a persistent connection from the browser to 
the server and is often used for real-time applications such as chat, news feeds and web push 
notifications. Node.

Question-What is the difference of JS from browser to JS on node.js?

Answer-
Unlike the browser where Javascript is sandboxed for your safety, node. js has full access to the 
system like any other native application. This means you can read and write directly to/from the 
file system, have unrestricted access to the network, can execute software and more.

Question-Write three different ways to reverse a string in Javascript? a. using inbuilt method, b. 
iteratively, c. recursively

Answer-
1. Reverse a String With Built-In Functions
For this solution, we will use three methods: the String.prototype.split() method, the 
Array.prototype.reverse() method and the Array.prototype.join() method.

    The split() method splits a String object into an array of string by separating the string into 
    sub strings.

    The reverse() method reverses an array in place. The first array element becomes the last and 
    the last becomes the first.

    The join() method joins all elements of an array into a string.

2. Reverse a String With a Decrementing For Loop
    function reverseString(str) {
    var newString = "";
    for (var i = str.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        newString += str[i];
    }
    return newString;
}
reverseString('hello');

3. Reverse a String With Recursion
For this solution, we will use two methods: the String.prototype.substr() method and the 
String.prototype.charAt() method.

    The substr() method returns the characters in a string beginning at the specified location 
    through the specified number of characters.

    The charAt() method returns the specified character from a string.

The depth of the recursion is equal to the length of the String. This solution is not the best one 
and will be really slow if the String is very long and the stack size is of major concern.

Question-What is shallow equal?

Answer-
A function for performing a shallow comparison between two objects or arrays. Two values have 
shallow equality when all of their members are strictly equal to the corresponding member of the 
other.
