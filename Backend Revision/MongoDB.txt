Question ~ What are SQL Databases? What are some companies that use SQL, what type of applications are these?
Answer ~
A database in SQL Server is made up of a collection of tables that stores a specific set of structured data. 
A table contains a collection of rows, also referred to as records or tuples, and columns, also referred to 
as attributes. Each column in the table is designed to store a certain type of information, for example, dates, 
names, dollar amounts, and numbers.

    - Microsoft.
    - NTT Data.
    - Cognizant.
    - Dell.
    - Accenture.
    - Stack Overflow

use - 
    - ETL Tools like Informatica, Talend, Pentaho, SSIS
    - Analytical tools like KNIME, RapidMiner
    - Back-end programming languages like PHP and Python
    - BI tools like Tableau, PowerBI, even Excel





Question ~ What are NoSQL Databases? What are some companies that use Mongo, what type of applications are these?
Answer ~
NoSQL database technology stores information in JSON documents instead of columns and rows used by relational 
databases. To be clear, NoSQL stands for “not only SQL” rather than “no SQL” at all. This means a NoSQL JSON 
database can store and retrieve data using literally “no SQL.” Or you can combine the flexibility of JSON with 
the power of SQL for the best of both worlds. Consequently, NoSQL databases are built to be flexible, scalable, 
and capable of rapidly responding to the data management demands of modern businesses.

Question ~ What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?
Answer ~
SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are 
table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores. SQL databases are 
better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.

Question ~ What are pipelines in aggregation?
Answer ~
An aggregation pipeline consists of one or more stages that process documents: Each stage performs an 
operation on the input documents. For example, a stage can filter documents, group documents, and calculate 
values. The documents that are output from a stage are passed to the next stage.
