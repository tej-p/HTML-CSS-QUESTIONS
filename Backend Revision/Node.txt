Question ~ Explain in brief what is node js?
Answer ~ 
(Node. js (Node) is an open source development platform for executing JavaScript code server-side. 
Node is useful for developing applications that require a persistent connection from the browser to the 
server and is often used for real-time applications such as chat, news feeds and web push notifications.)

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine 
and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command 
line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before 
the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" 
paradigm,[6] unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different 
languages for server-side and client-side scripts.
